This project is a real-time smart home automation interface built for the ESP32 platform. It features dual-mode operation (manual and automatic), gesture control, and real-time environmental monitoring using DHT11 sensors. The user interface is fully responsive and served directly from the ESP32 using LittleFS and ESPAsyncWebServer.
